The concat() method concatenates (joins) two or more arrays.

The concat() method returns a new array, containing the joined arrays.

The concat() method does not change the existing arrays.
The simplest way to merge arrays is by using the concat() method. 
It creates a new array that includes the elements from all the arrays provided as arguments.

The JavaScript spread operator (...) 
allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
Array destructuring:is a unique technique that allows you to neatly extract an array’s value into new variables.
Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set 
them into new, distinct variables. 
Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from an array​ at a time.

*TypeScript: it is superset of javascript. 
                -it is compile language. 
                -it is the strict type language. 
*software pre-requist: 
1.nodejs 
node -v // it will show node version. 
npm -v (node package mangaer) where we can find all the libraries it comes automatically 
2.TypeScript: 
npm i typescipt -g // 
tsc -v // it will display typescript version.
npx tsc -v 


js is first 
es5 2009 
es6 2015 
ts

*we can create ts file by writing filename.ts 
how to executed typescipt file 
step1:to compile the ts file by using (ts filename.ts ) //it will compile ts file and genrate plain js file. 
step2:node filename.js // it will execute js file 


*how to create variable in typescript 
syntax: let variableName:datatype; 

*data 

*oops 
1.class:it is collection of data-memeber and memeber-function. 
        -it is template which we can reuse. 
        -to create a class we use class keyword. 
        -class name must start with capital letter.
        class Classname{
            data-memeber and memeber-function
         }
-this keywword:it reperesent current or currnet object. 
2.object:  it is instance of class. 
            -by using object we can access class data-memeber and memeberfunction oustide class 
            syntax: let objName = new Classname(); 

            -constructor: it is special memeber function of class. 
                        -constructor execute automaticall when class object is created or intialize 
                        -constructor name must be only constructor in typescript 
3.Inheritance: Accessing parent class property into child class. 
                    to perform inheritance inbetween two class we use "extends" keyword.
                    syntax : class childClassNames extends parentClassName.
                    -super(): -it is reperesent parentclass inside the child class

4.polymorphism: ability to take more than one  form.
-method overloading: in this we have multiple method with same in same class 
-method overriding : in this we have multiple method with same name in different classes 
5.Abstraction: hiding internal and showing functionalities 
hiding implemenetation and showing only functionality. 
-we can achieve by using interface and abstraction method,static keyword. 

access Specifier: 
public: we can access class property inside  same class, outside class and in child class also 
protected: we can access class property inside same class, in child classbut not outside class
private:we can access property only within the class or within same class.
6.Encapsulation:wrapping or binding of data into single Unit. 

*module in type: it can be collection of single or multiple typescript file, containing code with specific 
                    purpose or task or operation that data or code we can access in another file by exporting and 
                    importing 
                    -we use export keyword to send data. 
                    -we use importing keyword to access data. 




*Interface: it is signature of class. 
                -it contain abstract method in it . 
                -in interface we do not implemenetation. 
                -its child class has a responsibility to implement interface. 
                -we create a interface by using interface keyword 
                --to perform inheritance in b/w class and interface we use "implements" keyword
