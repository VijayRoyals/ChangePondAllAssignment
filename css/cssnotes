                            property: value; 

                        }
        3.external css:in this we create a seperate css file and that css  file we import in html file by using link tag


                    syntax: selector { 
                            property: value; 

                        }

    *position: it is  use to move element after left, right, top and bottom value. 
                -because every element has by default position: static that why element will never move after applying left, right, top and bottom value.



    position:static; default 
    position:relative; // element can move by using left, right, top and bottom value.



    position :absolute; when we want child element must movee according its parent element, 

                     in this case parent element must have position: relative and child elementmust have

    *hover:The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.

Tip: The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.

Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and the :active selector to style the active link.

Note: :hover MUST come after :link and :visited (if they are present) in the CSS definition, in order to be effective!
